## Nice things people have said:

"Frances is an **absolute joy to work with**. Not only are her **UX/design skills & consultative abilities top-class**, she's an **inspiring and natural leader** who motivates and nurtures the team in what seems like an effortless manner."
Josie Downey, Information Architect at HeathWallace.

"Frances is an **incredibly friendly, talented and conscientious** person to work with. Always happy to take time and listen, she is **enthusiastic, has great attention to detail, without losing sight of the big picture, and works damned hard**, too. "
Rob Mansfield, Digital Content Editor at Time Inc UK.

Tara Hamilton-Whitaker, Director of Programmes at Time Inc UK.

**"Anyone who meets her and doesn't make her an instant offer is making one of the biggest mistakes possible for their company."**
Andy Jeffries, CTO at Absolute DevOps.

## Things I believe in:
* **purpose-driven organisations**, e.g. Zappos, Medium, Makers Academy, and **bringing your whole self to work**
* putting both **customer and employee experience** at the heart of an organisation
* doing a great job and **having a great time** doing it

## What I'm looking for:
I am open to collaborations and opportunities associated with:
* **positive psychology** / wellbeing / positive habit change
* **classical music**, esp. breaking down barriers / learning to play / sharing favourite pieces / playing with others
* **children**, encouraging their development, finding a way to balance working and parenting
* **startups** / entrepreneurship / solving juicy problems elegantly
* **bringing people together** / facilitating human connection

I would love to combine my UX background with my development skills, because I get a lot of joy out of bringing ideas to life. I am familiar with Ruby (vanilla, Sinatra, Rails) and JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, Meteor, React Native) and several testing frameworks, but could easily transfer to other languages and frameworks.

I'm based in Glasgow (UK) but I can travel occasionally, and I'm very experienced with remote working - from both a technical and a cultural viewpoint!
