## Things I believe in:
* **purpose-driven organisations**, e.g. Zappos, Medium, Makers Academy, and **bringing your whole self to work**
* putting **customer and employee experience** at the heart of your organisation

* **bringing people together** / facilitating human connection
* **classical music**, esp. breaking down barriers / learning to play / sharing favourite pieces / playing with others
